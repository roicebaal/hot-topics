      <h3>The Value of Money</h3>
      <p>
        Money is a coordination device. It stores effort across time and makes exchange cheap and fair.
        But its true value appears when it funds options: education, time with family, health, and the freedom
        to say “no.” Chasing money without intent often produces less happiness than using money deliberately
        to buy back time and reduce uncertainty.
      </p>
      <p>
        A simple rule: spend on things that compound—skills, relationships, and well-being—then automate the boring
        parts (budgets, bills, savings) so your attention isn’t spent micromanaging every dollar.

      <h3>GMO Food</h3>
      <p>
        “GMO” describes a method, not a single outcome. Like any tool, it can be used well or poorly.
        Many engineered crops target real-world problems: crop loss, vitamin deficiencies, or reduced pesticide use.
        The public’s trust hinges on transparency: clear labeling, rigorous testing, and equitable access
        so benefits aren’t captured by a few players.
      </p>
      <p>
        The practical stance: evaluate traits, not headlines.
        Ask: What was modified? Why? What independent evidence exists? How are farmers and ecosystems impacted?

      <h3>The World in 2100</h3>
      <p>
        By 2100, the arc likely bends toward electrification, abundant clean energy, and dense,
        walkable cities stitched with green transit. AI augments most work, but the premium remains
        on human taste, ethics, and coordination. Climate adaptation is a forever project: coastal defense,
        new crops, and smarter grids. The winners will be the communities that collaborate and share knowledge fast.

        Technology sets the menu; institutions decide the meal. Good governance and open standards turn inventions
        into everyday benefits.
